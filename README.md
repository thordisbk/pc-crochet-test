# Generative Crochet - Prototype

This prototype was created as part of my MSc in Games (Technology Track) Thesis at the IT-University of Copenhagen in the springs semester of 2021.

It is written in JavaScript using the Processing library p5.js. The protype can be viewed [here](https://thordisbk.github.io/pokr-thesis-generative-crochet/).
